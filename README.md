# Advertiser Dashboard Mobile App

### Installation

- Installing this code is really NOT recomended as the app requires API access that I am not at liberty to give out

- This project COULD be easily installed once cloned using `npx expo install [package name] -- -D`, `npm install`, or `yarn install` to configure all the various packages

### Notes

- This project was made by me and another contracted developer at the company I work for, I understand all parts of the projects and am confident enough to explain it

- The app is built using Typescript and Expo toolkit, the app uses stack navigation

- The code is all fairly organized: `/screens` for stacks, `/components` for reused app elements, `/features` for API calls, etc.

- Lots of the code was brought to react native from an existing web app offered by my company, I converted all of the code into typescript and rewrote the css into StyleSheet
